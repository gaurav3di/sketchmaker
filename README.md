## Configuration

### Authentication Configuration
Configure authentication settings in the admin interface (/admin/manage/auth):

#### Regular Authentication
- Enable/disable username/password authentication
- Configure password requirements
- Manage user registration settings

#### Google OAuth Setup
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
2. Create a new project or select existing one
3. Configure OAuth consent screen:
   - Select "External" user type
   - Add required app information
   - Add scopes: email and profile
4. Create OAuth credentials:
   - Create OAuth client ID
   - Select "Web application"
   - Add authorized JavaScript origins:
     ```
     http://localhost:5000 (development)
     https://your-domain.com (production)
     ```
   - Add authorized redirect URIs:
     ```
     http://localhost:5000/auth/google/callback (development)
     https://your-domain.com/auth/google/callback (production)
     ```
5. Copy Client ID and Client Secret
6. Configure in admin interface:
   - Enable Google authentication
   - Add Google Client ID
   - Add Google Client Secret

### Required API Keys (Admin Only)
Administrators configure these centrally for all users:
- **AI Providers**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, or Groq API key (at least one required)
- **Image Generation**: FAL API key (required for all image features)
- **Cost Control**: Centralized management prevents individual API key costs

### Email Configuration
Configure either SMTP or Amazon SES:

#### SMTP Settings
- SMTP Host
- SMTP Port
- SMTP Username
- SMTP Password
- TLS Support

#### Amazon SES Settings
- AWS Access Key
- AWS Secret Key
- AWS Region

### Subscription System Configuration

#### Initial Setup
The subscription system is automatically configured when you run the setup script:

```bash
python setup_subscriptions.py
```

This script will:
1. Create necessary database tables
2. Initialize default subscription plans (Free, Premium, Pro)
3. Assign free plans to all existing users
4. Display setup summary and statistics

#### Default Subscription Plans

| Plan | Monthly Credits | Features |
|------|----------------|----------|
| **Free** | 10 credits | Basic models, Standard resolution, Community support |
| **Premium** | 100 credits | All models, High resolution, Priority support, Custom LoRA training |
| **Pro** | 1000 credits | All models, Ultra-high resolution, Dedicated support, API access |

#### Automatic Credit Reset System
The subscription system uses APScheduler for intelligent, personalized credit management:

**How It Works:**
- Each user's credits reset monthly based on their individual subscription start date
- If you subscribe on January 15th, your credits reset on the 15th of every month
- APScheduler runs as a background service within the Flask application
- No external cron jobs or server configuration required

**Key Benefits:**
- **Fair allocation**: Users get their full monthly allowance regardless of when they join
- **Zero maintenance**: Completely automatic with no admin intervention needed
- **Precise scheduling**: Handles edge cases like month-end dates (Jan 31 â†’ Feb 28)
- **Persistent**: Survives application restarts and continues scheduling
- **Transparent**: Users see exact reset dates and countdown on their dashboard

**Admin Features:**
- Monitor all scheduled resets via the admin panel
- Force manual credit reset for any user if needed
- View upcoming reset schedule with exact dates and times
- Automatic scheduling when assigning new subscription plans
